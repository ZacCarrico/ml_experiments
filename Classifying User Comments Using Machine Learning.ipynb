The motivation for exploring this is to better understand why certain algorithms work well for topic classification. The four categories are 'alt.atheism', 'talk.religion.misc', 'comp.graphics', 'sci.space', and user posts are from a collection avialable from SciKit Learn"

    "Let's now see how we can improve the logistic regression by adjusting its regularization. Regularization can help us avoid learning too large of a weight for any single feature. There are two primary types for logistic regression: L1 (Lasso Regression) and L2 (Ridge Regression). The main difference between these two is that Lasso regression can bring the coefficient to zero, thus removing some features altogether. Ridge regression will not completely remove features. The default  regularization used for SciKit Learn's logistic regression is L2, which computes the coefficient size as the sum fo the squared weights.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's explore using either L1 or L2 regularization on F1 score. Getting into some details: the default tolerance (tol) value is 0.0001, which means that the tolearnce for collinearity cannot exceed 0.0001. This is strict and can lead to convergence problems so it will be relaxed to 0.01. For the logistric regression macro"

    "This shows that L1 regularization set 99% of the coefficients to 0, but both have about the same F1 score. That in itself is pretty interesting. Considering the other 99% of coefficients to improve things much, they seem like calculation dead-weight, and I'm preferring the leanness of L1 regularization. Let's see what happens if we try and improve upon L1 and L2 regularization by testing out different lambda coefficients.  \n",

    "The lambda coefficient determines how aggresively to try and reduce coefficient magnitude. A large lambda says, try really hard to reduce the magnitude of coefficients, while a small lambda says, don't worry too much about coefficient magnitude. In SciKit Learn's logistic regression class, they refer to C which is simply 1/lambda. Thus, if C is large large coefficients are not as penalized as when C is small."

    "These results show that the C hyperparameter has a much greater effect on logistic regression using L1 regularization. When C is low, it means that the coefficient weight has a very big effect on the cost function, thus, only those features with very strong correlations are retained. The less impactful feature coefficients become zero. There is a sweet-spot, in this case around a C of 1, for which there are enough non-zero feature coefficients to produce the highest F1 score, after which, setting more coefficients to zero is detrimental. This is all in contrast to L2 regularization for which the C hyperparameter has no effect because coefficients cannot be set to zero. This of it like multiplying all coefficients by the same value. It doesn't change the outcome because it hasn't changed the nature of the model."

One possible reason for the better performance of Naive Bayes is that Naive Bayes is less likely to overfit to the training data relative to logistic regression. To see if we can improve Naive Bayes further, let's attempt to improve its Laplacian smoothing hyperparameter. For scikit learn's multinomial Naive Bayes this is called alpha, and is the value added to all probabilities. A probability of zero for a feature, would completely eliminate the products of this zero probability feature, which can negatively impact prediction.\n"
